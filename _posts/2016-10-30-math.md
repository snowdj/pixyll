[Dot Products, Norms, and Angles Between Vectors](http://www.oxfordmathcenter.com/drupal7/node/168). 


Recall that the Law of Cosines, a generalization on the Pythagorean Theorem, gives us the relationship between the side lengths of an arbitrary triangle. Specifically, if a triangle has side lengths aa, bb, and cc, then

$$a^2 + b^2 - 2ab\cos \theta = c^2$$

where θ is the angle between the sides of length aa and bb.

Consider the triangle that can be formed from the vectors xx, yy, and x−yx−y.


Applying the Law of Cosines to this triangle, we have
$$||x||^2 +||y||^2 - 2||x|| \, ||y||\cos \theta = ||x-y||^2$$
