Mountains

This is the world with status quo power locked in and held tightly by the currently influential. Stability is the highest prize: those at the top align their interests to unlock resources steadily and cautiously, not solely dictated by immediate market forces. The resulting rigidity within the system dampens economic dynamism and stifles social mobility.
Mountains at a Glance

Advantage creates advantage – influence remains concentrated in the hands of the currently powerful. Rigid power structures and institutions hamper economic development. With fewer power-brokers, positive advances in secondary policy areas are feasible – e.g. compact urban development, energy and environmental stress. Positive resource expectations are realised and, with supportive policy frameworks in place, natural gas becomes a backbone of the global energy system. CO2 and environmental stresses are moderated by slower overall growth; the substitution of coal for natural gas, and the success of carbon capture and storage technologies.
