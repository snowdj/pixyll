 ### Standard linear form

Every first-order linear ODE can be written in standard linear form as follows:

y˙+p(t)y=q(t),
where p(t) and q(t) can be any functions of t.

When the right hand side q(t) is zero, we call the equation homogeneous. An equation that is not homogeneous is inhomogeneous .

 	Homogeneous: y˙+p(t)y	=	0	 
 	Inhomogeneous: y˙+p(t)y	=	q(t)	 
Models that use first order linear ODEs

First-order linear equations are common in modeling. Here are some examples.

Temperature conduction

Concentration diffusion

Radioactive decay

Bank account interest

Simple population growth

In this lecture we will focus in on the first example, and use a model for conduction called Newton Cooling.
