## good software

[MITx: 6.005.1x Software Construction in Java](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:MITx+6.005.1x+3T2016/courseware/Readings_Videos/01-Static-Checking/). 


 two topics:

static typing
the big three properties of good software
In this first reading, we’re going to talk about an important feature of Java that makes it different from other programming languages you may have learned, like Python and Javascript. That feature is called static typing.

From there, we’ll introduce the three big goals of this course, because this course isn’t really a Java programming course. We want to learn how to write good code in any language, and the three big ideas are about what we mean by good code. It should be:

safe from bugs, or in other words correct;
easy to understand for other programmers; and
ready to be changed in the future.
