What are those three lines between def a(x): and return x + 1? These lines are called the docstring of the function. A docstring is a special type of comment that is used to document what your function is doing. Typically, docstrings will explain what the function expects the type(s) of the argument(s) to be, and what the function is returning.
In Python, docstrings appear immediately after the def line of a function, before the body. Docstrings start and end with triple quotes - this can be triple single quotes or triple double quotes, it doesn't matter as long as they match. To sum up this general form:

### Week 4: Good Programming Practices > 7. Testing and Debugging 

#### Black-box testing is a method of software testing that tests the functionality of an application. Recall from the lecture that a way to think about black-box testing is to look at both:

    The possible paths through the specification.
    The possible boundary cases.

Undoubtably many - if not all - of the listed tests look like they would be pretty good for testing the function size. However, we want you to think critically about the way size is specified - including possible boundary cases - and pick a set of tests that adequately and fully tests all paths and boundary conditions. Be sure the set of tests you pick does not have extraneous, useless, or repetitive tests. 

A good black box test suite would contain tests for the following conditions: Empty set, Set of size 1, and Set of size greater than 1.

Black-box testing is a method of software testing that tests the functionality of an application. Recall from the lecture that a way to think about black-box testing is to look at both the paths through the specification and the possible boundary cases. In this example, the boundary cases all have to do with the size of aSet. Specifically these boundary cases are when aSet contains zero, one, or many items.

The remaining conditions would not further test the functionality of the size function because an odd, even, or prime sized set are all sets of size greater than 1. Nothing in the function specification suggests there is anything special or unique about odd, even, or prime sized sets, so testing those cases specifically simply repeats the test "Set of size greater than 1". 


**a path-complete glass box test** suite would find test cases that go through every possible path in the code. This is different from black-box testing, because in black-box testing you only have the function specification. For glass-box testing, you actually know how the function you are testing is defined. Thus you can use this definition to figure out how many different paths through the code exist, and then pick a test suite based on that knowledge.

Undoubtably many - if not all - of the listed tests look like they would be pretty good for testing the function maxOfThree. However, we want you to think critically about the way maxOfThree is defined - including possible boundary cases - and pick a set of tests that adequetly and fully tests all paths and boundary conditions. A good first step will be to look at the function definition and figure out what paths through the code exist. Then, look through the suggested test suites one test at a time and see if the suite tests every single path.


 a path-complete glass box test suite would find test cases that go through every possible path in the code. In this case, that means finding all possibilities for the conditional tests a > b and c > bigger. So, we end up with four possible paths that correspond to Test Suite A:

    Case 1: a > b and c > bigger - this corresponds to test maxOfThree(2, -10, 100).
    Case 2: a > b and c <= bigger - this corresponds to test maxOfThree(6, 1, 5)
    Case 3: a <= b and c > bigger - this corresponds to test maxOfThree(7, 9, 10).
    Case 4: a <= b and c <= bigger - this corresponds to test maxOfThree(0, 40, 20)

Test Suite B seems to explicitly test each of a, b, and c being the max of the three numbers, but this does not go through all possible paths in the code.

Test Suite C seems to be a good sampling of the space of input numbers, but it does not go through all possible paths in the code.
