**Exploratory data analysis** is detective work. 1
There is no excuse for failing to plot and look. 2
The greatest value of a picture is that it forces us to notice what we never expected to see. 3
It is important to understand what you can do before you learn how to measure how well you seem to have done it.


**Advantages of graphical EDA**

It often involves converting tabular data into graphical form. 1
If done well, graphical representations can allow for more rapid interpretation of data. 2

There is no excuse for neglecting to do graphical EDA.

While a good, informative plot can sometimes be the end point of an analysis, it is more like a beginning: it helps guide you in the quantitative statistical analyses that come next.
