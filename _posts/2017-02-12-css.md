## Add tags in your jekyll site

There is very good post about how to add a category and a tags page in your jekyll site.

https://codinfox.github.io/dev/2015/03/06/use-tags-and-categories-in-your-jekyll-based-github-pages/

I tried it and like the way the author format the tags in his tags page.

However in order to achieve that kind of the result, I need to add the a class for the tags in css file.

After 30 minutes search, I found different way to add a class in github.

Try them out, and finally get it working.

The takeaway message is that it takes time to figure it out, but it alwasys possible.
