## A New List of Research related to renewables energy senario generation

By using a set of possible power generation scenarios, renewables producers and system operators are able to
make decisions that take uncertainties into account, such as stochastic economic dispatch/unit commitment, optimal operation of wind and storage systems, and trading strategies (e.g., see [4], [5], [6] and the references within). Currently, most methods adopted a model-based approach [7], [8], [9], [10]. An explicit probabilistic model is first fitted from historical data, then it is sampled to generate new scenarios [11], [12], [13], [14], [15]. Some of these methods may also require pre-processing of data. For example, ARMA models may require the input data that are marginally distributed as Gaussian, so preprocessing is generally required.
