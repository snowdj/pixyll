## Ways to connect to Oracle Database




## Python

python-cx_Oracle

cx_Oracle version 7.0
cx_Oracle is a Python extension module that enables access to Oracle Database. It conforms to the Python database API 2.0 specification with a considerable number of additions and a couple of exclusions. See the homepage for a feature list.

cx_Oracle 7 has been tested with Python version 2.7, and with versions 3.5 and higher. You can use cx_Oracle with Oracle 11.2 and higher client libraries (including Oracle 18.3). Oracle's standard client-server version interoperability allows connection to both older and newer databases, for example Oracle 18.3 client libraries can connect to Oracle Database 11.2.
