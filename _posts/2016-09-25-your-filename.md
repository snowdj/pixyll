 The chart does seem to show that use of glyphosate and the number of cases of autism have both increased over time. However, based on this evidence we cannot confidently conclude that increased glyphosate use has caused an increase in autism. There could be many other factors not captured in this chart that have led to the increase in glyphosate use over time and to the increase in cases of autism over time.
 
 
 Professor Duflo presents various examples that demonstrate that caution should be used in collecting, presenting, and interpreting data, since it can sometimes be deceitful. One chart shows some kind of relationship between glyphosate and the number of cases of autism, while another shows some kind of relationship between organic food sales and cases of autism. Professor Duflo makes the point that researchers could focus on or drop certain portions of data in order to show support for whatever explanation or story they have in mind.
 
 
 Better scores and higher income earned are examples of direct effects of education, and hence are not considered to be positive externalities of education. One example of a positive benefit of education would be if parents that were highly educated children make better health and nutrition choices for their children, in turn positively investing in the next generation as a result. Better-educated children that become politicians or businesspeople as adults may create policies or businesses that better help their communities, another potential spillover benefit of education beyond the direct impact on the child’s educational and occupational outcomes themselves.
 
 
 Reverse causality and hidden/omitted variables are discussed in class as reasons that we should use caution before concluding that higher education leads to higher GDP. There could be other third factors that contribute to higher incomes as well as higher education levels which are not included in this simplistic model. There could also be some reverse correlation at play, where it is not necessarily the case that higher education leads to higher income, but rather than higher levels of income lead to higher education levels. In this example of outcomes as complex as national GDP per capita and education levels, there are likely many interrelated factors and interactions at play beyond what is included in this simplistic model.
 
 
 If we are able to control for a wide range relevant variables, this should allow us to better isolate the relationship of interest. However the difficulty is to be sure we have controlled for all the relevant variables.
 
  When running many regressions in a data set, there is the risk of “overfitting”: finding patterns by random chance in a particular data set that would not be found elsewhere because they are not real. We will see later in the course how this can be avoided, with a model (the position traditional econometrics take) or with statistical techniques (the position of Machine Learning)
