    Esc will take you into command mode where you can navigate around your notebook with arrow keys.
    While in command mode:
        A to insert a new cell above the current cell, B to insert a new cell below.
        M to change the current cell to Markdown, Y to change it back to code
        D + D (press the key twice) to delete the current cell
    Enter will take you from command mode back into edit mode for the given cell.
    Shift = Tab will show you the Docstring (documentation) for the the object you have just typed in a code cell - you can keep pressing this short cut to cycle through a few modes of documentation.
    Ctrl + Shift + - will split the current cell into two from where your cursor is.
    Esc + F Find and replace on your code but not the outputs.
    Esc + O Toggle cell output.
    Select Multiple Cells:
        Shift + J or Shift + Down selects the next sell in a downwards direction. You can also select sells in an upwards direction by using Shift + K or Shift + Up.
        Once cells are selected, you can then delete / copy / cut / paste / run them as a batch. This is helpful when you need to move parts of a notebook.
        You can also use Shift + M to merge multiple cells.
