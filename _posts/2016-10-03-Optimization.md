The Simplex Method for a maximization problem moves from extreme point to extreme point while increasing the objective value.

The simplex algorithm terminates if this occurs and simplex is guaranteed to terminate at an optimum solution if the problem is feasible.


There are two extreme points: (0, 0) and (0, 1).

There are two extreme rays. The first is the set of points {(λ,0):λ≥0}. The second is the set of points {(λ,1+λ):λ≥0}.


 Because each term of the objective function is guaranteed to be nonnegative, there can be no better solution. Note that (1,2) is not an extreme point of the feasible region. When optimizing a nonlinear function, the optimum is not guaranteed to occur at an extreme point.
 
 A good way to determine which one to store is to solve the problem five additional times. The first problem includes one extra storage unit for chicken. The second problem includes one extra storage unit for beef. And so on. If you do this, you will find that storing 1 extra kg of tofu increases the profit the most. There are other approaches for solving this problem. Next week, we will learn integer programming models. It is possible to write a single model for finding the solution. In the fifth week of this course, you will learn about sensitivity analysis. You can determine the answer from the sensitivity report.
 
 
 The point of Problem 1 is that there are multiple ways of representing integer programs. Some are better in practice because they help the algorithm to find the optimum faster. 
 
 
 
 Select the correct way of modeling this “OR” constraint using linear and integer constraints. 
 
 
 Consider two non-negative integral variables x1 and x2. Suppose that x1≤60 and x2≤50. Model the following constraint using an additional binary variable w:

x1<30 or x2≥20.
 
It is often difficult to work with strict inequalities when modeling MIPs (Mixed Integer/Linear Programs). In this case, x1 is known to be integer valued. We transformed "x1<30" into "x1≤29."

In order to make the constraint x1≤29+M(1−w) redundant when w=0, one needs M to be at least 31. In order to make the constraint x2≥20–Mw be redundant when w=1, we need M to be at least 20.


A basketball coach is trying to come up with a team for the following match. He has a total of 9 players from which he must select 5 . Assume these 5 players will play the whole game. Consider there are three positions players can play: guard, forward, and center. So the team of 5 players will consist of 2 guards, 2 forwards, and 1 center. Players 1,2,3,4,8,9 can play guard, 3,4,5,6,7,8,9 can play forward, and 8,9 can play center.

Consider the decision variables as xi for i∈{1,…,9} so that xi=1 if the coach selects player i , and xi=0 otherwise and examine the IP below. Note that since there is no objective, we state the linear objective as 0.

The IP formulated below requires that we select five players, and that at least two of these five can play guard; at least two can play forward; at least one can play center. If we solve this integer program, and obtain a feasible integer solution, is the solution guaranteed to produce a feasible five person team?






$$\left.\begin{array}{rrcl} \min & 0 \\
                    \text {s.t.:} & & & \\
                    & x_{1} + x_{2} + x_{3} + x_{4}+x_8+x_9 \geq 2 \text{ (2 Guards)}\\
                    & x_{3} + x_{4} + x_{5} + x_{6}+x_{7}+x_{8}+x_9 \ge 2 \text{ (2 Forwards)} \\
                  & x_{8} + x_{9} \ge 1 \text{ (1 Center)} \\
                    & \sum_{i=1}^{9}x_{i} = 5 \text{ (5 players)} \\
                    & x_{i} \in \{0,1\}  \quad \forall i\in\{1,\dots,9\} \text{ (Binary)} \\
                    
                    \end{array}\right\}$$



False

The above IP isn't a correct formulation for our problem. The constraints do ensure that we have 5 players, 2 of which can play guard, 2 forward and 1 center. However, it doesn't guarantee that we can take these five players (from the optimal solution) and assign two of them as forwards, two of them as guards and the remaining player as center.

For instance, consider the solution that picks players 5,6,7,8,9. Players 5, 6 and 7 can only play forward. That means that the two guards and the center must be chosen from the remaining two players, which is impossible.

Historical note: The above false formulation for the basketball problem was (incorrectly) given as the answer by the staff of 15.053 for a quiz in 15.053. If you didn't see why this model was incorrect, you are definitely not alone.


Which of the statements or constraints below is (by itself) equivalent to the statement "If x1=1, then x2=0"?
 
 
 x1 + x2 <=1
 
 
 
#### Integer Programming Formulation, eHarmony

eHarmony is an online dating site focused on long term relationships. It takes a scientific approach to love and marriage. About nearly 4% of US marriages in 2012 are a result of eHarmony. The company has generated over $1 billion in cumulative revenue from 2000, the year it was founded. Unlike other online dating websites, eHarmony does not have users browse others' profiles. Instead, eHarmony computes a compatibility score between two people and uses optimization algorithms to determine their users' best matches. In this problem, we are going to see how eHamony uses integer programming to find good matches. The compatibility scores in the table below indicates how compatible a match is. A higher number indicates that the compatibility is greater.



A combinatorial auction is an auction in which participants can place bids on sets of items, instead of placing bids on individual items. A combinatorial auction is useful in many situations. For example, consider the problem of an airline company buying takeoff and landing slots at an airport: clearly, the value of a single slot may be small if the slot is taken by itself, but the value may be much larger if several slots can be bought at the same time, allowing the company to setup flight routes according to the desired timetable. Thus, the airport wants to sell its available slots to airline companies maximizing its own profit (i.e. the total value at which the slots are sold), allowing airlines to bid on sets of items and choosing the most profitable combination of bids among the received ones. Many other examples exist. In this problem, we study a simple formulation for a combinatorial auction.


The local post office requires full-time employees to meet demands that vary from day to day. The number of full-time employees required on each day is given in Table 1. Each full-time employee must work five consecutive days and then receive two days off. For example, an employee who works Monday to Friday must be off on Saturday and Sunday. This schedule for employees repeats every week. We want to formulate an integer program that the post office can use to minimize the number of full-time employees who must be hired.


#### the game of Fiver
This problem will be based on the game of Fiver. It is also sometimes called called Lights Out and you can try your hand at the game here and for more details check out the Wikipedia page here.

Assume we have a 5x5 grid that initially consists of all white blocks. When we click on a block, it flips its color (from white to black or from black to white) and that of adjacent (vertical and horizontal) blocks. Can you make all of the blocks black? The game is illustrated in this figure. For a documented illustration, click here.

We wish to write an optimization problem whose solution solves the problem in the fewest moves.

We will model it is an integer program. Let x(i,j)≥0 denote the number of times we click on the block in row i and column j.

Consider the element in row 3, column 2 again. Using the results from PARTS A, B, and C, write a constraint that guarantees it turns black. For the answers, assume that there is a constraint
x(i,j)+x(i,j−1)+x(i,j+1)+x(i−1,j)+x(i+1,j)=w(i,j)
Assume also that x(i′,j′) is binary for all i′,j′ and y(i,j)∈{0,1,2} .

Perhaps one could express it more succinctly in a manner similar to the way that the constraint in PART D is given. Ideally, one would only need to write a constraint for Block(i,j) and let i vary from 1 to 5 and let j vary from 1 to 5. One runs into a difficulty though. The constraint for Blocks (1, 1) includes just three of the x decision variables. It would be


x(1,1)+x(1,2)+x(2,1)−2y(1,1)=1,


where all four of these variables are binary. (Do you see why y(1,1) can be restricted to be binary?) Similarly for Blocks (1, 5), (5, 1) and (5, 5). Other Blocks in which i or j = 1 or 5 include 4 decision variables. It would seem difficult to be able to express all 25 constraints very succinctly. 

However, there is a way to do so. It involves creating "dummy decision variables." How many additional dummy variables do you think are needed? HINT: it is more than 23 and less than 25. (Yes, the previous question was intended as a joke. But now that you know the answer, see if you can figure out a clever way of writing the constraints succinctly if you are allowed the 24 extra dummy variables. This number arises because 72−52=24. The explanation for this exercise will be given when the solutions for the problem set are released.)

### Facility Location 


Facility Location 1 Exercise


Suppose that students are not required to dine, and let vs be the number of such students. If a student at location s chooses not to dine, then the disutility for that student is gs. How would the model change if this possibility were permitted? Select one objective and two constraints.

Solution

The correct answer is:

New objective: ∑d inDfdyd+∑s∈S∑d∈Dcsdxsd+∑s∈Sgsvs. We are minimizing, and so we should add the disutility.

New constraint: ∑d∈Dxsd+vs=ns for s∈S. For each location s∈S, vs is equal to the number of students at location s who do not dine at one of the facilities.

New constraint: vs≥0 for s∈S.

he correct answer is:

x1≥300w

x4≥300(1−w)

w∈{0,1}

These three constraints ensure that at least one of the corners 1 and 4 must be illuminated with at least 300 units of illumination.

xi≤150+150(1−zi)∀i∈{1,…,5}

∑i=15zi≥3

zi∈{0,1},∀i∈{1,…,5}

These three constraints ensure that at least three or more of the corners must be illuminated by 150 units of illumination or less. To see that, if zi=1, then the corresponding corner i will need to have less than 150 units of luminosity. However, if zi=0, then the corresponding constraint becomes xi≤300, which will be satisfied anyway since the maximum luminosity we can have at an intersection is 300.∑i=15zi≥3 ensures that at least three intersections will have this “less than 150 units of luminosity” requirement.

0.6x1−0.4x3≤0

This constraints is derived from the fractional constraint x1(x1+x3)≤0.4, where x1 is the luminosity at intersection 1 and x1+x3 is the luminosity of corridor B. We then multiply x1+x3 on both sides of the inequality (since we know that x1+x3 is strictly positive), we get this linear constraint.





The solution (x∗,y∗) can remain a unique optimal solution. This situation occurs, for example, if the change in the costs is very small.

The solution (x∗,y∗) remains optimal, but there are multiple optimal solutions. This situation can occur if the change in the costs is "just right." For example, if the cost function changed to ‘‘z=2R+2G", then the solutions (5, 3) and (2, 6) are both optimal, as are all of the solutions on the edge joining these two points.

A solution other than (x∗,y∗) is the unique optimal solution. This situation can happen if, for example, one cost coefficient changes a lot. If the objective were ‘‘z=.1R+2G", the optimum solution would be (2, 6).




#### Shadow Price 


The purpose of this week is how to get an additional information without re-solving the probrem.

For this problem, the problem of Max  is equal to that of Max . Furthermore, the latter has the same solution as Max (The value of objective function would be different but the  and  are the same).

$$\frac{3}{2}(2G+\frac{20}{3}R)$$

We have the sensitivity report for Max  and know the range of the coefficient for  not changing the solution (i.e. allowable increase/decrease of  in the sensitivity report).




##### Changing Coefficients







The correct answer is 2. We are changing two RHS coefficients. By the 100% rule, we divide all allowable changes of RHS coefficients in the SR by 2. After dividing by 2, we see that the allowable increases of 2 for production capacity and 15 for warehouse capacity are allowed. The change in the optimal objective value is (2×11/14)+(15×1/35)=11/7+3/7=2.



##### Pricing Out


The correct answer is -1.0.

We change the capacity coefficient from 10 to 22. To determine the reduced cost, we can then subtract the product of the constraint coefficients and shadow prices from the cost coefficient, resulting in 6−(8×1114)−(22×135)=42070−44070−4470=−6470=−0.91

The reduced	cost	of	a	variable	(say	x 3 )	is	the	shadow	price	of

Consider the glass problem, with the following adjustment. Suppose instead that the coefficient for production capacity for champagne glasses decreased from 8 to 7, and simulataneously the coefficient for storage increased from 10 to p.

For what values of p is it worth producing champagne glasses?

The correct answer is:

‘‘p≤17.5."
If we price out champagne glasses, the reduced cost is 6−7×(11/14)−p×1/35=.5−p/35. This value is non-negative whenever p≤17.5.






It should increase by 4857.14. To determine the allowable increases when two cost coefficients change, one needs to divide the allowable increases by 2 (using the 100% rule). The number of cameras and memory sticks produced does not change because we remain within the (modified) allowable increase/decrease region suggested by the sensitivity report.


Reducing the number of Test Device 3 hours by 50 could affect total revenue, but we do not have enough information to compute the magnitude of the change. The allowable decrease is is 2342.86, or 39 hours, which the suggested 50 hour reduction exceeds.




We remain within the allowable decrease region for cameras, and reduce the profit by the product of the unit decrease and number of units. The new optimal profit is 125×171.4285714+135×800, which is approximately 129428.57.
 
 
 
 For a single unit, we have 92−12×20=−148. One should also subtract the coefficient for circuit boards in other constraints times the shadow prices. However, the shadow prices for Test Device 2 capacity and Test Device 3 capacity are both 0. And the shadow price on the upper bound for circuit boards is also 0.
 
 Using the special case of the 100% rule given in 15.053x, we need to divide the allowable increases and decreases by 2. The revised allowable increase for device 1 availability is 1640. The revised allowable decrease for circuit board demand is 350. Thus, the combined change in RHS is within the revised limits. The change in objective follows is 1000× [shadow price for device 1] −200× [shadow price for circuit board demand]. This is equal to 1000×20=20000.


The extreme points are (0,1),(1,0),(0,2),(2,0),(4/3,4/3) and the optimum value of −4 is achieved at (0,1). Tracing out the simplex algorithm depends on where you start. If you happen to start from the extreme point (2,0), the simplex algorithm will either trace (1,0),(0,1) or (4/3,4/3),(0,1) in order.

Suppose that the objective function is changed to z=−x1+cx2. Graphically determine the values of c for which the solution found in part (a) remains optimal


The correct answer is:

−1≤c≤0

For −1≤c≤0, the extreme point (0, 1) is optimal. For c=0 the optimum extreme points are (0,1) and (0,2). For c>0, (0,1) is not optimal anymore. Similarly, for c=−1, (0,1) and (1,0) are both optimal. For c<−1, (0,1) isn't optimal anymore.
