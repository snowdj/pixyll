## MSY

最大可以打多少鱼。

G' = 0


MB = 0

需要多少E.

How many traps need to be set to catch the MSY.


$$𝐇( 𝐄, 𝐒_{𝐌𝐒𝐘}) = 𝐞 𝐄 𝐒_{𝐌𝐒𝐘} = 𝐌𝐒𝐘$$




## Sustainable yield, 
or steady state harvest, as a function of effort, H(E).

In SS, \\(G(S) = H(E,S)\\). This condition can be used to derive the sustainable stock size
as a function of effort:

Substituting S(E) into to the harvest production function gives H(E):


## 不是越卖力，越有效率

鱼是有限的可再生资源，太卖力，S 下降， H 下降，赚的少。

## static efficient sustainable yield.

要赚最多的钱，需要打多少鱼。

MB = MC

MB = P H'(E)

$$MC = \frac{dTC}{dE}$$
