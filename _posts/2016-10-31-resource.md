## MSY

the stock size that supports the maximum sustainable yield, \\(S_{MSY}\\( 

最大可以打多少鱼。

G' = 0


MB = 0

需要多少E.

How many traps need to be set to catch the MSY.


$$𝐇( 𝐄, 𝐒_{𝐌𝐒𝐘}) = 𝐞 𝐄 𝐒_{𝐌𝐒𝐘} = 𝐌𝐒𝐘$$




## Sustainable yield, 
or steady state harvest, as a function of effort, H(E).

In SS, \\(G(S) = H(E,S)\\). This condition can be used to derive the sustainable stock size
as a function of effort:

Substituting S(E) into to the harvest production function gives H(E):


## 不是越卖力，越有效率

鱼是有限的可再生资源，太卖力，S 下降， H 下降，赚的少。

## static efficient sustainable yield.

要赚最多的钱，需要打多少鱼。

MB = MC

MB = P H'(E)

$$MC = \frac{\partial TC}{\partial E}$$


* **Note**: Previously, the syntax for entering LaTeX inline was “$latex 2+2$,” whereas now I can type “\\( 2+2 \\)$”  and “\\[ 2+2 \\]” for block math rendering.

MathJax
Then I added MathJax – basically this meant including MathJax on the _includes/head.html page and a few other tweaks. In head.html, I included the block:

<script type="text/javascript" src="http://cdn.mathjax.org/mathjax/latest/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS-MML_HTMLorMML">
