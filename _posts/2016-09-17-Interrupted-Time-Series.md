## UBCx: ITSx Policy Analysis using Interrupted Time Series
### OBSERVATIONAL STUDY DESIGNS


In a pre-post study design, the counterfactual assumption is that the level of the outcome would not have changed absent the change being studied. 

In a post-only with control study, the assumption is that the counterfactual outcome in the intervention group would have mirrored that observed in the control group. This study design is very prone to selection bias. It is likely that the locations vary on a number of other factors -- both observable and unobservable -- that impact fuel sales.


has data for two groups at one time period before the intervention and one time period after. This reflects a pre-post with control design.
