## UBCx: ITSx Policy Analysis using Interrupted Time Series
### OBSERVATIONAL STUDY DESIGNS


In a pre-post study design, the counterfactual assumption is that the level of the outcome would not have changed absent the change being studied. 

In a post-only with control study, the assumption is that the counterfactual outcome in the intervention group would have mirrored that observed in the control group. This study design is very prone to selection bias. It is likely that the locations vary on a number of other factors -- both observable and unobservable -- that impact fuel sales.


has data for two groups at one time period before the intervention and one time period after. This reflects a pre-post with control design.


The counterfactual assumption in this study design is that the outcome would have changed in the invention group in the same manner as the control group absent the intervention.

School break is clearly an event that occurs between the periods, so is a history threat to validity. However, in this case as it only affects one group and not the other, it is an interaction with selection in this instance.

the second example is a potential threat to validity. While the first looks like a history threat, the timing would have to be close to the intervention in order to be of concern. The second is an example of an instrumentation threat and is of concern as it happened close to the intervention. Finally, migration out is an issue of maturation, but because it was constant over the entire period would not constitute a threat to validity. Any changes in the outcome this caused would likely be addressed by the estimate of the pre-intervention time trend.
