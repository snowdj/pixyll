## EViews

EViews documents (also known as “workfiles”) are files that hold different objects (which contain data). Unlike Microsoft Word or Excel, EViews does not open up a blank document upon launch. Instead, the user must always specify the structure (or frequency) of the file, a range for the data, and a sample. A workfile is made up of one or more page files.

EViews allows the user to create an empty workfile (i.e., one without any data) and to create a workfile by importing data from another program.

There are three types of workfile structures available in EViews:

1. Dated/regular frequency (for time series data)

2. Unstructured/undated (mostly for cross-sectional data)

3. Balanced panel (for panel data).

A workfile can have multiple pagefiles, each of a specific (possibly different) type. However, series objects in a specific pagefile must have the same structure (frequency).




The range of the workfile allows for up to 140 observations while the current (or active) sample allows for a maximum of 100 observations.
