```
library(plotly)
# The diamonds dataset
str(diamonds)

# A firs scatterplot has been made for you
plot_ly(diamonds, x = ~carat, y = ~price)

# Replace ___ with the correct vector
plot_ly(diamonds, x = ~carat, y = ~price, color = ~carat)
        
# Replace ___ with the correct vector
plot_ly(diamonds, x = ~carat, y = ~price, color = ~carat, size = ~carat)
```

You will work again with the diamonds dataset. The goal is to create a bar chart that buckets our diamonds based on quality of the cut. Next, for each cut, you want to see how many diamonds there are for each clarity variable.
