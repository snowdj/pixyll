Pelican can integrate jupyter notebook, so it is very good for teaching.

## A New Way to Write Post


pip install typogrify


Visitor's browser will make separate HTTP requests to fetch `elegent.css`,
`custom.css`, `pygments.css` and `tipuesearch.css`. These four separate
requests can be avoided using [Pelican plugin
`assets`](https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-plugins/tree/master/assets).

Install the required packages

    :::bash
    pip install webassets cssmin

Then enable `assets` plugin in your configuration.

    :::python
    PLUGINS = ['assets']

This minor fix will improve the load speed of your website. All four style
sheets will be merged and minified into one style sheet, `style.min.css`.

Compact CSS will save many bytes of data which in turn will improve page speed
and parse time.
