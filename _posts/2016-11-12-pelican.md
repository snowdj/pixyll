Pelican can integrate jupyter notebook, so it is very good for teaching.

## A New Way to Write Post


To work it out, it is better to learn virtualenv.

now some pelican themes can support ipython plug in.


1. ipynb plug in
https://github.com/danielfrg/pelican-ipynb

The author of this plugin has his own theme. Pretty good.
https://github.com/danielfrg/danielfrg.github.io-source

2. 
I use elegant theme, but it only works in python 2.7 for some packages dependency reason.

3. octpress 
such as jack
http://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2013/05/07/migrating-from-octopress-to-pelican/
4. bootstrap 3
such as standage.github.io-pelican

5. Flex

the code highlighting is now working very well.

pip install typogrify


Visitor's browser will make separate HTTP requests to fetch `elegent.css`,
`custom.css`, `pygments.css` and `tipuesearch.css`. These four separate
requests can be avoided using [Pelican plugin
`assets`](https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-plugins/tree/master/assets).

Install the required packages

    :::bash
    pip install webassets cssmin

Then enable `assets` plugin in your configuration.

    :::python
    PLUGINS = ['assets']

This minor fix will improve the load speed of your website. All four style
sheets will be merged and minified into one style sheet, `style.min.css`.

Compact CSS will save many bytes of data which in turn will improve page speed
and parse time.


## Nikola

might be a alternative for pelican.
http://www.damian.oquanta.info/posts/deploy-your-nikola-powered-blog-content-from-the-ipython-notebook.html

It suppport ipython notebook well and speed faster.

http://www.damian.oquanta.info/index.html

is a very good blog about using ipython notebook.

Very good information of programming as well.

DEPLOY_COMMANDS = ["git add .",
                   "git commit -am 'Update'",
                   "git push origin master",
                   "git subtree split --prefix output -b gh-pages",
                   "git push -f origin gh-pages:gh-pages",
                   "git branch -D gh-pages"]
                   
                   
                   


Do you want to easily deploy your site to Github pages?

OK, here we go...

    You have to upload your complete blog/site to a new Github repository (you know how to do it... if not, probably you need to learn some things before try this one, hehe). As a plus, now your blog/site is version-controlled!

    Almost for sure, your site/blog lives in the master branch of the new repository, but you need to generated a gh-pages branch to push your build or output folder, I mean your site/blog content to deploy... not all the machinery of your site/blog platform (Nikola in my case):
        git checkout -b gh-pages
        git rm -rf .
        git commit -am "First commit to gh-pages branch"
        git push origin gh-pages

    Now, we will use a git-subtree technique to push the build or output content to the gh-pages branch:
        git checkout master

        git push origin `git subtree split --prefix output gh-pages`:gh-pages --force

        Sweet line... uhh ;-)

    Finally, you will need to run the following line every time you want to update your site/blog!
        git subtree push --prefix output origin gh-pages

Note: Are you getting git errors? Just use the sweet line again and force the update...

If you are using Nikola, you can add some of this lines to the DEPLOY_COMMANDS in your conf.py file and just run nikola deploy after building your site/blog.

More easier... impossible... ;-)

Dami√°n.

UPDATE: Not enough happy with step 3 and 4 (essentially because of some git errors), I figured out a cleaner solution:

New 3. Now, we will use a git-subtree technique to push the build or output content to the gh-pages branch. You will need to run the following lines every time you want to update your site/blog!

    git checkout master # you can avoid this line if you are in master...
    git subtree split --prefix output -b gh-pages # create a local gh-pages branch containing the splitted output folder
    git push -f origin gh-pages:gh-pages # force the push of the gh-pages branch to the remote gh-pages branch at origin
    git branch -D gh-pages # delete the local gh-pages because you will need it: ref
