Pelican can integrate jupyter notebook, so it is very good for teaching.

## A New Way to Write Post


To work it out, it is better to learn virtualenv.

now some pelican themes can support ipython plug in.


1. ipynb plug in
https://github.com/danielfrg/pelican-ipynb

The author of this plugin has his own theme. Pretty good.
https://github.com/danielfrg/danielfrg.github.io-source

2. 
I use elegant theme, but it only works in python 2.7 for some packages dependency reason.

3. octpress 
such as jack

4. bootstrap 3
such as standage.github.io-pelican

5. Flex

the code highlighting is now working very well.

pip install typogrify


Visitor's browser will make separate HTTP requests to fetch `elegent.css`,
`custom.css`, `pygments.css` and `tipuesearch.css`. These four separate
requests can be avoided using [Pelican plugin
`assets`](https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-plugins/tree/master/assets).

Install the required packages

    :::bash
    pip install webassets cssmin

Then enable `assets` plugin in your configuration.

    :::python
    PLUGINS = ['assets']

This minor fix will improve the load speed of your website. All four style
sheets will be merged and minified into one style sheet, `style.min.css`.

Compact CSS will save many bytes of data which in turn will improve page speed
and parse time.

might be a alternative for pelican.

It suppport ipython notebook well and speed faster.

http://www.damian.oquanta.info/index.html

is a very good blog about using ipython notebook.

Very good information of programming as well.
